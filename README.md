# My Markdown Page Title

This is some standard Markdown text. I'm going to follow it up with a styled HTML block.

<div style="background-color: #e6f7ff; border: 1px solid #91d5ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 20px;">
    <h3>Important Note!</h3>
    <p>This entire box, including the heading and paragraph, was created using raw HTML and inline CSS.</p>
</div>

And here is more Markdown text following the HTML block.
