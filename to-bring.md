## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I offload my backpack?
Of course you can, but the information has to reach us when you book the trek. We will let you know the offloading charge which is to be handed over to the trek leader, in cash. In case you decide to offload on the spot, on the trail, you may have to pay a higher price than usual.

### Are there any toilet/washroom facilities on the trek?
We can give you cover at the campsites. Toilet tents will be provided with pits dug inside them. Shovels will be provided inside the tent to cover the waste after you have made your business. You can use your toilet rolls. In case you use toilet rolls throw them in the pits and cover them along with your waste with loose soil. There will be no facility for bathing during the trek.

### Are trekking poles necessary?
Well trekking poles give you extremely good balance and grip, but they are not mandatory as such if you have exceptionally good stability.

### What kind of food will be provided on the trek?
Vegetarian food will be served throughout the trek. The only non-vegetarian item served on our treks are eggs. Packed lunch will be provided to you on the days you are trekking. You are requested to carry your own tiffin box, spoon and mug to consume food.
